# Drawbotics Styleguide

 This is the app used to showcase the Drawbotics styles and components, to be used both by devs and non-devs.

 It uses all the packages that define components i.e. `react-drylus`, `vanilla-drylus` and eventually `drylus-web-components`.

 Nothing particularly fancy about this.

 ## Development
```
npm start
```

To build the static app (served through Github pages)
```
npm run build
```
