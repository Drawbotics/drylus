import Playground from '~/components/Playground';


# Button Link
Basically the same component as [`Button`](/components/button) but the base element is a `span` rather than a `button`. This is done so that we can style a link as a button, since `button` is not a valid child of `a`. An equivalent example would be the [`TextLink`](/components/text-link).

```jsx
import { ButtonLink } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```
__Example__
<Playground component={ButtonLink}>
  <ButtonLink>Button Link</ButtonLink>
</Playground>

An example usage would be the following:
<Playground>
  <a href="#">
    <ButtonLink>To nowhere</ButtonLink>
  </a>
</Playground>
