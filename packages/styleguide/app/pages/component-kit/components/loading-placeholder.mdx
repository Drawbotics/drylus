# LoadingPlaceholder
Used to create a loading effect to the UI, and replace a boring spinner. For the best effect you should compose multiple of these to replicate the UI you're loading. The same effect is used on components with `isPlaceholder`.

```jsx
import { LoadingPlaceholder } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```
__Example__

<Playground component={LoadingPlaceholder}>
  <LoadingPlaceholder />
</Playground>
