# Upload Box
This component is displayed to show a "upload file" cue to the user. It can be clicked, or used as a drag-and-drop area for files. The component also exposes the `uploadFile` and `uploadFiles` functions that can be used with any other element to trigger an upload.

**NOTE**: this component will upload the file to the given target url (should be provided by the backend server), but then depending on the implementation you might still need to call a mutation to create the final attachment object in the database.

```jsx
import { UploadBox } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```
__Example__

<Playground component={UploadBox}>
  <UploadBox
    onComplete={(uploads) => console.log('Upload completed for: ', uploads.map((upload) => upload.file.name).join(', '))}
    onProgress={(file, e) => console.log('Upload progress: ' + Math.round((e.loaded / e.total) * 100) + '% for', file.name)}
    signingUrl={process.env.EXAMPLE_API_HOST + '/rails/active_storage/direct_uploads'} />
</Playground>

The component is most often coupled with the [`AttachmentBox`](/component-kit/components/attachment-box) and [`AttachmentList`](/component-kit/components/attachment-list) component to display the upload progress.

Try to upload some files to see it in action. The example is limited to 1 file at a time.
<Playground mode="jsx">
  <RenderChildren defaultValue={{}}>
    {({ state, setState }) => (
      <div style={{ width: 400 }}>
        <Margin size={{ bottom: Size.DEFAULT }}>
          <UploadBox
            signingUrl={process.env.EXAMPLE_API_HOST + '/rails/active_storage/direct_uploads'}
            onProgress={(file, e) => setState({ ...state, [file.name]: (e.loaded / e.total) })}
            onFinish={(file) => setState({ ...state, [file.name]: -1 })}
            fullWidth />
        </Margin>
        <AttachmentList>
          {Object.keys(state).map((filename) => (
            <AttachmentBox
              key={filename}
              onClickDownload={state[filename] === -1 ? () => {} : null}
              onClickClose={() => {}}
              fileName={filename} progress={state[filename] != -1 ? state[filename] : null} />
          ))}
        </AttachmentList>
      </div>
    )}
  </RenderChildren>
</Playground>

## Error example
By default the upload box does not allow for multiple files, so if someone tries to drag and drop more than 1 file nothing happens. You are provided a `onMaxFilesExceeded` callback that can be used to set the component to its error state if you want to show a message; you can also show an alert for example.

export const ExampleWrapper = ({ children }) => {
  const [error, setError] = useState();
  return children({ error, setError });
}

<Playground mode="jsx">
  <ExampleWrapper>
    {({ error, setError }) => (
      <UploadBox
        error={error}
        onMaxFilesExceeded={() => setError('You can only upload 1 file at a time')}
        onInit={() => setError(null)}
        onComplete={(uploads) => console.log('Upload completed for: ', uploads.map((upload) => upload.file.name).join(', '))}
        onProgress={(file, e) => console.log('Upload progress: ' + Math.round((e.loaded / e.total) * 100) + '% for', file.name)}
        signinUrl={process.env.EXAMPLE_API_HOST + '/rails/active_storage/direct_uploads'} />
    )}
  </ExampleWrapper>
</Playground>

## Upload Helper
Used internally by `UploadBox`, this style-less component can be used to wrap any element that can be used as an upload trigger e.g. a button. Note that only "click" events will trigger the file browser, and not onDrop, like is the case with the `UploadBox`. If you want `onDrop` functionality for custom component you should implement it yourself.

```jsx
import { UploadHelper } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```

<Playground component={UploadHelper}>
  <UploadHelper>
    <Button category={Category.BRAND} leading={<Icon name="upload" />}>Upload</Button>
  </UploadHelper>
</Playground>

## Exposed functions

```jsx
import { uploadFiles, uploadFile } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```

`uploadFiles` takes 3 arguments:
- `files`: the list of files to be uploaded, should be of `FileList` type, retrieved from the input event or equivalent
- `signinUrl`: the URL where the attachments will be signed, usually ends with `direct_upload`
- `extra`: an object containing all the event callbacks (see `UploadHelper` props' starting with `on`), in addition to a `sanitize` function, again same type as the `UploadHelper` one.

`uploadFile` is similar, also takes 3 arguments like above, but:
- `file`: singular, file to be uploaded
- `siningUrl`: idem
- `extra`: same object as above but without the `onInit` and `onComplete` callbacks since those are called when all the multiple attachments are uploaded. For the same result with this function you may use the equivalent `onStart` and `onFinish`
