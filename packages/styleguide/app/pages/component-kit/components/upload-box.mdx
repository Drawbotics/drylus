# Upload Box
This component is displayed to show a "upload file" cue to the user. It can be clicked, or used as a drag-and-drop area for files. The component also exposes a raw `upload` function that can be used with any other element to trigger an upload.

```jsx
import { UploadBox } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```
__Example__

<Playground component={UploadBox}>
  <UploadBox />
</Playground>

The component is most often coupled with the [`AttachmentBox`](/component-kit/components/attachment-box) component to display the upload progress.
