# Animated Item

Used in conjunction with `AnimationGroup` (see below) this component allows you to add animations to the UI easily. Using `Framer` under the hood most of the animation should work automatically. There are a couple of props available to customize the animation to better suit the interface.

For common patterns you can see the examples below:


__Usage__

```jsx
import { AnimatedItem } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```

__Example__
<Playground component={AnimatedItem}>
  <AnimatedItem><div></div></AnimatedItem>
</Playground>


# Animation Group

__Usage__

```jsx
import { AnimationGroup } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```

__Example__
<Playground component={AnimationGroup}>
  <AnimationGroup>
    <AnimatedItem>Item</AnimatedItem>
  </AnimationGroup>
</Playground>
