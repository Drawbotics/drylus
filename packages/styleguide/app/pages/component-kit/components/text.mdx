### With Date
`Text` is also a smart component in the sense that depending on the children passed to it, it will render them accordingly.
For example, if you pass an instance of `Date`, the date will be formatted following the Drawbotics conventions. You can modify the formatting through the `dateFormat` prop.
<Playground mode="jsx">
  <Text>This is a text with a date: {new Date()}</Text>
  <br/>
  <Text>This is a text with currency: {{ value: 30, currency: 'EUR' }}</Text>
  <br/>
  <Text>I bought a bread for {{ value: 1, currency: 'EUR' }} on the {new Date('04-20-2019')}</Text>
</Playground>
