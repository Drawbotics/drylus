# Animation

Here are some examples using the different animation and animated components found in the component kit, namely [`AnimatedItem`](/component-kit/components/animated-item), [`Flex`](/component-kit/layout/flex) and [`Grid`](/component-kit/layout/grid).

Patterns:
- [Dashboard grid](/component-kit/animation/dashboard-grid) - uses animated `Grid`, animated `Flex` and `AnimatedItem`
- [Toolbar with profiles](/component-kit/animation/toolbar) - uses animated `Flex`
<!-- - [Panel with rows and a sidebar](/component-kit/animation/rows-and-sidebar) - uses animated `Flex` and `AnimatedItem` -->
- [Animation between route changes](/component-kit/animation/route-changes) - uses `AnimatedItem` with `AnimationGroup` + `animateExit`
