# Constants

You will see that throughout the design system, sometimes you are required to use one of some possible values for a particular prop, for example when choosing a `category` for a `Button`. Here are the 3 basic constants we provide for those components (note that some components expose their own constants, like `FlexJustify` in `Flex`).

You can import them like so:
```jsx
import {
  Tier,
  Category,
  Size,
  Align,
  Position,
  Color,
  Shade,
} from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```

| Name | Usage | Values |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| Size | To define a size, margin or padding | `EXTRA_SMALL`, `SMALL`, `DEFAULT`, `LARGE`, `EXTRA_LARGE`, `HUGE`, `EXTRA_HUGE`, `MASSIVE` |
| Category | Used with any component where the color determines a particular kind of action, to differentiate its usage (e.g. buttons or banners) | `BRAND`, `SUCCESS`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `DANGER` |
| Color | Similar to Category except it is tightly linked to the displayed color | `RED`, `BLUE`, `ORANGE`, `GREEN`, `BRAND` |
| Tier | Used whenever the hierarchy is needed to determine the usage of a component (e.g. buttons) | `PRIMARY`, `SECONDARY`, `TERTIARY` |
| Position | Used to position elements, usually in regards to a parent element | `TOP`, `BOTTOM`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` |
| Align | Often used with text components. Layouts have their own align constants  | `LEFT`, `CENTER`, `RIGHT` |
| Shade | Used to determine the lightness/darkness of color e.g. in Text | `DARK`, `MEDIUM`, `LIGHT` |
