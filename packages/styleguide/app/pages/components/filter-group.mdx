# FilterGroup

In order to allow decluttering of the UI in smaller screen sizes, we provide an additional component called `FilterGroup`. You can see the API below:

<PropsTable component={FilterGroup} />

By wrapping your filters (and other elements if necessary) with this component, they will be rendered in a separate panel in mobile, which is accesed by pressing the button rendered by the component.
