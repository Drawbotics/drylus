# Filter

A filter uses a number of other UI elements. For example, we may use a date picker to filter by date, or a list of checkboxes to filter by a particular criterium. The component exposes the `BaseFilter`, which is used to create custom filters, but also provides pre-built common components, see the examples below for more details.

<Playground component={BaseFilter}>
  <BaseFilter label="Filter" />
</Playground>

#### Examples

<Playground component={SelectFilter}>
  <SelectFilter />
</Playground>
