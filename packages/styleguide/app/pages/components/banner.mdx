# Banner
Component used to display an important message that should take precedence over the rest of the content of the page. Similar to [`Callout`](/components/callout), but used to the inform the user of possible actions he needs to make, or as a result of an _uncontrolled_ effect. Cannot be dismissed.

```jsx
import { Banner } from '@drawbotics/react-drylus';
```
__Example__
<Playground component={Banner}>
  <Banner title="You don't have enough credits" category={Categories.DANGER}>
    Your order will not go into production because your credit number is below 0. Click <TextLink underlined={LinkUnderlined.ALWAYS}>here</TextLink> to buy more credits.
    <Margin size={{ top: Sizes.SMALL }}>
      If you don't buy more in 10 days your order will be void.
    </Margin>
  </Banner>
</Playground>

For small information snippets you can leave it without title to be more concise and use less space.

<Playground>
  <>
    <Margin size={{ bottom: Sizes.DEFAULT }}>
      <Banner category={Categories.INFO}>
        A new service is now available.
      </Banner>
    </Margin>
    <Margin size={{ bottom: Sizes.DEFAULT }}>
      <Banner category={Categories.WARNING}>
        You used all your correction rounds.
      </Banner>
    </Margin>
    <Margin size={{ bottom: Sizes.DEFAULT }}>
      <Banner category={Categories.DANGER}>
        Your floorplans will not go into production, we need them to get started.
      </Banner>
    </Margin>
    <Banner category={Categories.SUCCESS}>
      Congratulation, you can now send your items to production.
    </Banner>
  </>
</Playground>

Banners can also be given a CTA by passing a trailing component, which should always be a `Button`. CTAs are _especially_ useful in `DANGER` category banners, as they provide the user with a possible solution. Here is an example:
<Playground>
  <Banner
    category={Categories.DANGER}
    trailing={<Button trailing={<Icon name="alert-triangle" />}>Buy credits</Button>}>
    Your floorplans will not go into production, we need them to get started.
  </Banner>
</Playground>
