# Hint
Used to display hints or errors on form elements. You should __never__ have to use this in anything other than complex `FormGroups`, if you need to set a hint to a form element use the `hint` or `error` props already provided. It sets its own margin on top, so no need to set that yourself.

<Playground component={Hint}>
  <Hint>This is a hint</Hint>
</Playground>
